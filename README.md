## Customer Churn Prediction

Customer attrition, or churn, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. This can significantly impact a company's revenue, making it crucial to understand why customers are leaving and take steps to reduce churn. Identifying at-risk customer segments and implementing retention strategies are key measures. By leveraging data and machine learning, companies can predict which customers are likely to churn and proactively take actions to retain them.

In this project, we will build a basic model to predict customer churn using the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). We will use classification algorithms along with Python tools such as pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualizations.
